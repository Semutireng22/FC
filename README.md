### Status

- The xpaths have been updated and new xpaths have been written to xpath.py you can replace the new file with the old file. Since i had to rush throught this if i missed something please let me know

- The layout of Faucet Crypto has changed and the bot won't work anymore you can wait for me to release the updated xpath file or you can add them manually to the xpath.py file.

- The issue of the bot was unable to find the claim button was fixed. The reason was due to an update in Faucet Crypto website. New xpaths have been updated you can copy the new xpaths to your old xpaths file.
(keep and eye on the bot status for further changes and updates that might occur.)

<!-- Browser preference -->
### Brave Browser

The browser of choice for this project is Brave browser due to its native
ad-blocking scripts which are pretty good and prevents random popup openings,
which can mess with the bots proper execution.

If you don't have Brave browser installed you can download it from here.

### Changes

- Added logic to save cookies and use them for logging in. This prevents
using the default profile directory of your browser and dosen't mess it up.

- Added logic to close the welcome modal and chat which covered the dashboard
visibilty.

- Cookies are now saved to a cookie file if it is not present in the directory
the bot will automatically login with the user email and password provided on 
the config file and generate a new cookie file.

- Added proxy incase you want to generate some referrals. This method is not
recommended yet and try this at your own risk.

- Fixed the issue when the browser was running in normal mode the bot closing all
the open tabs.

### Setup

### Account setup

If it's your first time running the bot you need to login to Faucet crypto.
Run the bot in normal-mode(default) it will redirect to login page where you can login,
the bot will do the rest from there by collecting from all the ads. (Note) The bot can't
yet do the exe.io and fc.lc shortlinks so you would have to help it do that. If you've logged in successfully then you can run the bot in headless mode from then on you can set the bot
to headless mode by setting the "headless" flag in the config file.

```python
browser-mode = "headless"
```
